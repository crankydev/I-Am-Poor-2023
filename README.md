# I-Am-Poor-2023

 
This is the second app from my (re)Boot Camp (2023 reboot of the Udemy iOS App Development course).

On this reboot of my iOS Dev journey, I'm going to be using Xcode to both show my work as well as to summarize my learning through each unit/project.

The second app was a challenge to apply the lessons and reinforce skills introduced in the first app (I Am Rich).

Reinforced skills:

* Basic use of Xcode IDE
* Adding and editing Storyboard elements using editor tabs/inspectors (background color, label, and image view)
* Customizing design elements (colors, fonts, etc.) using the storyboard editors
* Adding and managing .xcassets files
